In the #scorekeeper we will make a game that will consist of 2 players.
Objective: to get to the specified number first.
How to set up this game:
1) Created a html and js file.
2) Built the boilerplate in addition to adding a script tag to connect the 2 files.
3) Gave each button an id so that we could reference it in our js logic.
4) Used two vars to specify the different <buttons> that would have an .addEventListener on.
